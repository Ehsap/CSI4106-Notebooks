Once you have the optimal solution, then you would be able to run *simulated annealing* a 1000 times and measure how many times the simulated annealing reaches that optimal solution (or a nearby solution).  You could compare that to running 1000 times the greedy search and measuring how many times the greedy search reaches the optimal solution.  Which is better???"
